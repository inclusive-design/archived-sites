<h1>Hartland Drive Sidewalk Survey </h1>
<p>Welcome neighbours! </p>
<p>In early March,  I distributed a survey asking residents of Hartland Dr. about their potential interest in the installation of sidewalks. This was a private survey to help me determine if the informal support I was hearing for the idea was actually representative of the opinions of a majority of the owners. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Results (19 of 28 Hartland Owners Responded):</h3>
<p> 1. Are you in favour of sidewalks for Hartland Drive?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Comments received from those answering &quot;Yes&quot;. (oral comments in <em>italics</em>, my responses in <strong>bold</strong>): </p>
<ul>
  <li>Sidewalks would improve the dilapidated condition of our roadway, poor ditch runoff, constant need for homeowners to resod/reseed ditch due to oversalting etc. </li>
  <li>Sidewalks with curbs would really add to the street's appearance and would be much safer. My dad asked the city about this years ago and would be glad to see someone else carrying on. </li>
  <li>[Install] a speed limit sign going eastbound and southbound around the corner (they used to have one years ago) .
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Good idea. We should pursue this regardless. </strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Better to have level sidewalks vs. being graded for driveways, for pick-ups.</li>
  <li>Presumably both sides would have at least curbs.</li>
  <li>Grass strip facilitates fall leaf placement and snow piling.</li>
  <li>Would the city provide small-habit trees on grass strip as in illustration? 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I can't speak for the city. The residents might also ask the residents association.</strong> </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Comments received from those answering &quot;No&quot;. (oral comments in <em>italics</em>, my answers in <strong>bold</strong>): </p>
<ul>
  <li>Will have to pay more taxes.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>There is no automatic tax for sidewalks. Sidewalks could increase taxes if they cause the average selling price in the area to increase.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Residents will be responsible for snow removal in front of homes (not the City's responsibility). 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The city decides which &quot;priority sidewalks&quot; they will clear. Balsam is currently on the list (http://www6.mississauga.ca/onlinemaps/tranwork/design/html/swguide/Z10surr.htm). </strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Liability for accidents that occur on sidewalks (if someone slips on ice, homeowner is responsible).
    <ul>
      <li><strong>According to the The Star: &quot;Provincial law requires municipalities to maintain all sidewalks. They can pass bylaws like Toronto's requiring homeowners to clean snow from adjacent sidewalks. But courts have ruled that if someone slips and falls, municipalities are liable. (Homeowners could become responsible if they've blocked the sidewalk).&quot; (http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/577174)</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Will bring unnecessary pedestrian traffic into neighbourhood creating more opportunity for vandalism and other crime.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Any increase in pedestrian traffic would probably just be people who currently walk along Hindhead. </strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Will bring pedestrian traffic closer to our front doors.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If the &quot;no grass strip&quot; design is adopted, the distance involved  will be about a metre. </strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Width of sidewalk and grass strip will shorten length of front lawns.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If the &quot;no grass strip&quot; design is adopted, the distance involved  will be about a metre. </strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No place to put leaves for municipal removal.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I agree that the ditches are handy for this. </strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Historical nature of community will be irreversibly destroyed.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I would contend that the ditches are not what makes the commmunity historic. Originally, the roads were not paved, but this change didn't destroy the community. </strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Traditions set by longtime and senior residents who have maintained unique character of neighbourhood will be ignored. 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>There were a mix of young and old residents on both sides of the issue.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Residents' association has debated the merits of such a project in the past and has decided against it.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To my knowledge, this is the first survey of Hartland residents regarding sidewalks on Hartland. The previous survey done by the residents association only asked about sidewalks for Hindhead.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Not a safety matter. There have been no pedestrian fatalities or accidents as a result of traffic in the past 25 years. 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I'm of course very glad to hear this. Here are some general statistics: http://www.tc.gc.ca/roadsafety/tp/tp2436/rs200401/rs200401e.pdf</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Water in ditches a non-issue concerning mosquitoes. Water from winter thaw and spring rains long gone before the nesting and hatching period of mosquitoes in the late summer. Further, Peel Region's Health Department reports no human cases of West Nile Virus in 2008, 2007 and 2006.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I did</strong><strong>n't want to make a big deal about West Nile (mosquitos are annoying regardless), but here is what Peel Health says:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>&quot;Stagnant water with a high organic level that stays for longer than seven days is an ideal breeding site for mosquitoes, especially between mid-May and the end of August.&quot; (http://www.peelregion.ca/health/westnile/rep-stwater-deadbirds.htm</strong><strong>) </strong></li>
            <li><strong>In 2006, Peel had 2 cases in Brampton (http://www.peelregion.ca/health/westnile/updates/pdf/2006/Sept17-23-Stakeholderupdate.pdf)</strong></li>
          </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Ditches act as catch-basins, preventing flooding.</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>According to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) basements generally flood through basement wall cracks or backups of sewers. When you see water in a ditch, the water isn't just in the ditch, that's the saturation level of the water in the ground around your house. (http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/gemare/gemare_002.cfm) If anything, then, the poor ditch drainage we have now is keeping the water saturation levels higher than they would be with storm sewers. </strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Cars may drive faster without people walking on the roadway.</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>That may be true for people who care about pedestrians, but my concern is mainly with people who don't. </strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>While &quot;Yes&quot; responses outnumbered &quot;No&quot; responses, the margin was modest (10-8). I think it is most fair to conclude that &quot;while a majority of Hartland residents favour sidewalks, a very sizeable minority do not&quot;.</li>
  <li>The other questions were usually only answered by people voting Yes to sidewalks, but the results are clear, those people favour a sidewalk on the south-east side (the outside of the curve) with a no grass strip design - minimizing the impact on front yards. </li>
  <li>I think it's fair to say that the people favouring sidewalks are not intent on radically changing the look or nature of the community, so perhaps a compromise design of some kind can be found.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Next Steps: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>I plan to report the numerical results and my conclusion that opinion is split slightly in favour to the residents association (on which I sit). </li>
  <li>It is my understanding that the city repairs streets on a multi-year cycle. </li>
  <li>I will suggest that when Hartland's year comes up (I have no idea when this will be) that an official survey of Hartland residents be conducted and that the survey contain some compromise alternatives.</li>
